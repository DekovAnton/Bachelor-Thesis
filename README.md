### Test Program for Automatic Acquisition of Efficiency

This repository contains a test program designed for the automatic acquisition of efficiency for power converters in DC-DC Mode only. This Python program includes a GUI, making it easily accessible for any user.

## Features
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** User-friendly interface for intuitive operation.
- **Protocol Support:** Requires instruments that support:
  - VISA (Virtual Instrument Software Architecture) for communication.
  - SCPI (Standard Commands for Programmable Instruments) for command and control.
- **Data Visualization:** Real-time data display and analysis tools.
- **Excel Integration:** Import and export data using Excel templates.
- **Customizable Testing:** Configurable test parameters for different types of power converters.

## Needed Hardware

To effectively use this test program, you will need the following hardware:

1. **Power Converter:** Device under test (DUT) operating in DC-DC mode.
2. **Measurement Instruments:**
   - **DC Power Supply:** A Power Supply that can be used to measure Voltage/Currents.
   - **DC Load:** A programmable DC load.
3. **Interfaces and Connections:**
   - **Communication Interface:** Instruments must support VISA for integration.
   - **Cables and Connectors:** Required for connecting instruments to your computer.

## Installation
Program is in raw code.
All dependencies are in the repo.
